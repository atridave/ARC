# Automatic Rigging for 3D Characters

Abstract:-

Rigging articulated 3d characters with additional
parts requires manual rigging to specify its
internal skeletal structure. I am presenting a
method for rigging characters automatically. My
method adapts user data for specific internal
skeletal part & automatically creates rig for it.

Introduction:-

Depending on story requirement & vision of
creative director we have verity of character
design of creatures. Most of the time this designs
are inspired from natureâ€™s real creatures & then
there are few enhancements & mix match for
most of the character.
Mammals & noun mammals have most
of the conman skeleton parts like
legs, hand, head, spine, finger, neck etc.

As we can see in most of the Arm Skeleton
shoulder, elbow & fingers are Common parts.
Difference between this entire skeleton is length,
various Bone numbers & mechanism of
kinematics.
The key for Rigging any skeleton is to find out
Bone numbers , placement & function of
skeleton .
